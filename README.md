# spelling-correction
Trying to predict a misspelled words using k-nearest neighbors algorithm.

Procedure:
Tf-idf of corpus data is calculated,

when prediction word is given, tf-idf of the same is calculated and 
k nearest neighbours algoritm is implemented to search or possible anwers

Somethings to keep in mind:
all algoritms are implemented using numpy arrays and without use of any other libraries 
so this script will be computatinally heavy when compared to optimised libraries like sklearn.
